**From Minoa**: The story goes - I told Tristan to stop using "@everyone" for every announcement, and we got into an argument. To sum it up, he said I have no life, and I replied, "You can't talk when your entire life is on a t-shirt." I sent him the "Eat, Sleep, Game, Repeat" t-shirt, but he didn't have a comeback. Then he said, "Oh, you want to fight after school?" and I said no. He removed all my permissions, even though I did all the hard work on the server. The only thing he did was buy it. He removed my perms and banned me. Then, at lunch, he had a friend come up, steal something, and run off. It's crazy, and I'm mad at him. He is telling everyone that I just snitched on him for no reason, when there's a full story, and in my opinion and others', I am in the right.
